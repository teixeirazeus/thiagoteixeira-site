I am a computer scientist, founder of  [DevHops](https://devhops.com.br/).

I have some scientific papers published, you can see the list in my [Lattes resume](http://lattes.cnpq.br/1506806182041109).

The topics in computing that interest me most are:

 - Artificial Intelligence
 - Image processing
 - Heuristic methods

This site is a repository for texts that I wish to make public.

I believe that the use of social networks can be somewhat destructive because of the nature of how they are constructed. With artificial intelligences optimized to keep you on them for as long as possible, moderating content and inducing you to extreme opinions. Resulting in a distorted view of reality.

I won't elaborate here, maybe I will in a post. The point is that I don't feel comfortable expressing myself on a social network, or on a platform that is not in my control. If you are not an IT person, watch the documentary [The Social Dilemma](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11464826/). Yes, you can find it on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224).

The result is the creation of this site. Dark mode, comfy and with green text [h4ck3r](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOP1LNr70aU) style.
