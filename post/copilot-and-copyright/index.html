        <p>Copilot is a code autocomplete tool created using artificial intelligence.</br>
Autocomplete tools that use artificial intelligence are not new. However, the copilot is different.</br>
Copilot uses state of the art in artificial intelligence to create code, training with millions of open-source projects.</br>
This is a great tool for developers, but it also raises some questions about the future of open-source projects.</br></p>
<h1 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual property</h1>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s talk about intellectual property.</br>
Intellectual property is a legal right that gives the author of a work the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, perform, and display the work publicly.
This right is valid for a certain time, after which the work enters the public domain.</br>
The premise of intellectual property is that the author of the work should be rewarded for his work.
And is the State, that has the monopoly of the force, that grants this right to the author.</br>
In the end, is just one more paper that the State creates and forces us to obey.
However, the intellectual property never makes sense in the real world. Especially in the physical world.</br></p>
<p>In the physical world, you have to manage how the distribution of final resources will be done.</br>
If I have a book, I can sell it, give it away, or burn it.</br>
But is only one book. If my neighbor wants to read it, he has to buy it, or I have to give it to him.</br>
Maybe I can copy it, but I have to use my paper, ink, and time to do it.</br></p>
<p>Understand that the final resource in this case is the book. Not what is inside the book, written by the author.</br></p>
<p>So, intellectual property is a legal fiction created by the State. Is not property, is one monopoly that the State grants to the author.</br></p>
<h1 id="code-license">Code license</h1>
<p>Code license is the same thing, applied to the digital world.</br>
But in the digital world, the final resource simply does not exist. Only the computer memory.</br>
If I have a movie on my computer, I can torrent it, or I can copy it to a pen drive and give it to my neighbor. I can make millions of copies and I will still have the original.</br></p>
<p>To deal with this, many code licenses were created. In the open-source world, the most common is the MIT license and the GPL license.</br>
The MIT license is a permissive license, that allows you to do almost anything with the code.</br>
The GPL license is a copyleft license, that forces you to share the code with the community.</br>
You can use the code, but you have to give credit to the author.</br>
This is cool because you incentivize the community to share the code, the developer is rewarded with fame, and the community is rewarded with the code.</br></p>
<p>Now imagine this case:</br>
You have a really hard problem to solve, like how to sort a list of 1000 banana objects.</br>
You read a lot of open-source code, and one day you have to solve the banana sorting problem.</br>
You remember quite a solution you read, you know that is the best way in the world to solve this problem, and you implement it.</br>
And after a few days, you discover that you cannot use this solution in your work, because the license does not allow you to do it.</br>
Imagine how hard is to know the answer to a problem, and not be able to use it. And the only thing that stops you is a fairy tale created by the State.</br></p>
<p>If you are not a tech person, just imagine that one day is forbidden to mix coffee and milk.</br>
You can drink coffee, and you can drink milk, but you cannot mix them. That is ridiculous.</br></p>
<h1 id="copilot">Copilot</h1>
<p>Copilot is artificial intelligence, not a human being.</br>
You cannot expect artificial intelligence to respect the same rules that a human being respected. Especially if the rule does not make sense.</br>
I am using copilot to code and write this article. The result is amazing, especially with the boring parts of coding.</br>
If I was artificial intelligence and read all the code in the world. I would be able to know the best or at least the most common, way to solve a problem.</br>
I am optimized to write the best code possible, and I am not optimized to respect the license. And that is the way it should be because all this thing about copyright does not make sense in the first place.</br></p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Technological advance is faster than society can adapt. That&rsquo;s created this kind of problem.</br>
We are creating the future, and we are not ready for it. It is like we are inventing the nuclear plant, and the population is still using candles. Saying that the earth is flat or something.</br>
All these discussions about copyright had to have been buried by the time that torrent was invented. The pirate bay, sci-hub, and all the other sites that share knowledge should be legal.</br>
All the society benefits from this, and the only one that loses is the State.</br></p>
<p>What is the solution to this problem? I don&rsquo;t know. But we have to find a solution because the future is coming.</br>
This is nothing compared to what is coming. We are going to change more dramatically and faster. And we have to be ready for it.</br></p>
